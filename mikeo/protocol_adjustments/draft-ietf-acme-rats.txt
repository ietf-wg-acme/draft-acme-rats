1.  Introduction

   ACME [RFC8555] is a standard protocol for issuing and renewing
   certificates automatically.  When an ACME client needs a certificate,
   it connects to the ACME server, providing a proof of control of a
   desired identity.  Upon success, it then receives a certificate with
   that identity in it.

   These identities become part of the certificate, usually a Fully
   Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) that goes into the Subject Alt Name
   (SAN) for a certificate.  Prior to ACME, the authorization process of
   obtaining a certificate from an operator of a (public) certification
   authority was non-standard and ad-hoc.  It ranged from sending faxes
   on company letterhead to answering an email sent to a well-known
   email address like hostmaster@example.com, evolving into a process
   where some randomized nonce could be placed in a particular place on
   the target web server.  The point of this process is to prove that
   the given DNS FQDN was controlled by the client system.

   ACME standardized the process, allowing for automation for
   certificate issuance.  It has been a massive success: increasing
   HTTPS usage from 27% in 2013 to over 80% in 2019 [letsencrypt].

   While the process supports many kinds of identifiers: email
   addresses, DTN node IDs, and can create certificates for client use.
   However, these combinations have not yet become as popular, in part
   because these types of certificates are usually located on much more
   general purpose systems such as laptops and computers used by people.

   The concern that Enterprises have with the use of client side
   certificates has been the trustworthiness of the client system
   itself.  Such systems have many more configurations, and are often
   considered harder to secure as a result.  While well managed mutual
   TLS (client and server authentication via PKIX certificate) has
   significant advantages over the more common login via username/
   passowrd, if the private key associated with a client certificates is
   disclosed or lost, then the impact can be more significant.

   The use case envisioned here is that of an enterprise.  A Network
   Operations Center (NOC) (which may be internal or an external
   contracted entity) will issue (client) certificates to devices that
   can prove via remote attestation that they are running an up-to-date
   operating system as well as the enterprise-required endpoint security
   software.

   This is a place where Remote Attestation can offer additional
   assurance [RFC9334].  If the software on the client is properly
   designed, and is up to date, then it is easier to assure that the
   private key will be safe.

   This can be extended to Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) by having those
   devices provide an equivalent Attestation Result.

   In this document, we propose an approach where ACME Server MAY
   challenge the ACME Client to produce an Attestation Evidence or
   Attestation Result in any format that is supported by the RATS
   Conceptual Message Wrapper [I-D.ietf-rats-msg-wrap], for instance, an
   EAT (entity attestation token).  The ACME Server then verifies the
   attestation result against an appraisal policy as required by by the
   requested certificate profile.

   ACME can presently offer certificates with multiple identities.
   Typically, in a server certificate situation, each identity
   represents a unique FQDN that would be placed into the certificate as
   distinct Subject Alt Names (SAN).  For instance each of the names:
   example.com, www.example.com, www.example.net and
   marketing.example.com might be placed in a single certificate for a
   server that provides web content under those four names.

   This document defines a new identity type, trustworthy that the ACME
   client can ask for.  A new attestation-result-01 challenge is defined
   as a new method that can be used to authorize this identity using a
   RATS Passport model.  The attestation-evidence-02 challenge is also
   defined, enabling a background check mechanism.

   In this way, the Certification Authority (CA) or Registration
   Authority (RA) issues certificates only to devices that can provide
   an appropriate attestation result, indicating that the device from
   which the ACME request originates has passed the required security
   checks.

   Attested ACME requests can form an essential building block towards
   the continuous monitoring/validation requirement of Zero-Trust
   principle when coupled with other operational measures, such as
   issuing only short-lived certificates.

   For ease of denotion, we omit the "ACME" adjective from now on, where
   Server means ACME Server and Client means ACME Client.

1.1.  Attestation Results only

   This document currently only defines the a mechanism to carry
   Attestation Results from the ACME client to the ACME server.  It
   limits itself to the Passport model defined in [RFC9334].

   This is done to simplify the combinations, but also because it is
   likely that the Evidence required to make a reasonable assessment
   includes potentially privacy violating claims.  This is particularly
   true when a device is a personal (BYOD) device; in that case the
   Verifier might not even be owned by the Enterprise, but rather the
   device manufacturer.

   In order to make use of the background check that Evidence would need
   to be encrypted from the Attesting Environment to the Verifier, via
   the ACME Server -- the Relying Party.  Secondly, in order for the
   ACME Server to be able to securely communicate with an Enterprise
   located Verifier with that Evidence, then more complex trust
   relationships would need to be established.  Thirdly, the Enterprise
   Verifier system would then have to expose itself to the ACME Server,
   which may be located outside of the Enterprise.  The ACME Server, for
   resiliency and loading reasons may be a numerous and dynamic cluster
   of systems, and providing appropriate network access controls to
   enable this communication may be difficult.

   Instead, the use of the Passport model allows all Evidence to remain
   within an Enterprise, and for Verifier operations to be more self-
   contained.

1.2.  Related work

   [CSRATT] define trustworthy claims about the physical storage
   location of a key pair's private key.  This mechanism only relates to
   how the private key is kept.  It does not provide any claim about the
   rest of the mechanisms around access to the key.  A key could well be
   stored in the most secure way imaginable, but in order to use the key
   some command mechanism must exist to invoke it.

   The mechanism created in this document allows certification authority
   to access the trustworthiness of the entire system.  That accessment
   goes well beyond how and where the private key is stored.  ACME uses
   Certificate Signing Requests, so there is no reason that [CSRATT]
   could not be combined with the mechanism described in this document.

   [RATSPA] defines a summary of a local assessment of posture for
   managed systems and across various layers.  The claims and mechanisms
   defined in [RATSPA] are a good basis for the assessment that will
   need to be done in order to satisfy the trustworthiness challenge
   detailed in this document.

2.  ACME Extensions

2.1.  'rats' identifier

   A new identifier type to indicate client support or server request
   for remote attestation.  This is a "dummy" identifier in that the
   value does not contain an actual identifier, but instead a property
   that is the be remotely attested.  The value MAY be left empty, or
   contain a property hint as per Section 4.

   type (required, string):  The string "rats".

   value (required, string):  A string from the ACME Attest Claims Hint
      Registry defined in Section 4, which could be the empty string.

   A Server MAY issue challenges for multiple "rats" identifiers in the
   same ACME protocol flow.

   The Client MUST complete the challenge by returning a CMW
   [I-D.ietf-rats-msg-wrap] which MAY contain remote attestation data in
   any format (EAT (cite), WebAuthn (cite), TPM attest_certify (cite),
   PKIXKeyAttesation (cite), proprietary, etc), and of any RATS
   conceptual message type (evidence, endorsement, or attestation
   result).  This document does not remove the need for vendors to
   perform interoperability testing with CAs to ensure compatibility.

2.2.  remote-attest-01 Challenge

   A remote-attest-01 challenge type asks the Client to prove provide
   remote attestation.  The Client SHOULD use the provided
   freshness_nonce as an attestation freshness nonce, if the Client's
   underlying attestation technology supports freshness nonces.

   The Server MAY include a attestClaimsHint containing a list of claims
   that it would like to see in the

   This section describes the challenge/response extensions and
   procedures to use them.

2.2.1.  remote-attest-01 Challenge Object

   The remote-attest-01 Challenge Object is:

   The basic fields type (which MUST be "remote-attest-01"), url,
   status, validated and error are preserved from Section 8 of [RFC8555]
   un-modified.  The following new fields are added:

   freshness_nonce (required, string):  A randomly created nonce
      provided by the server which MUST be included in the Attestation
      Results to provide freshness.  EDNOTE TODO: we should decide
      whether this nonce MAY / SHOULD / SHOULD NOT / MUST NOT be the
      same as the ACME nonce or the ACME Challenge URL.

   attestClaimsHint (optional, list of string)  If the Server requires
      attestation of specific claims or properties in order to issue the
      requested certificate profile, then it MAY list one or more types
      of claims from the newly-defined ACME Attest Claims Hints registry
      defined in Section 4.

   verifierEncryptionCredential (optional, string url)  A URL where the
      Client can fetch the encryption public key that it can use for
      encrypting the rats challenge response.

   The attestClaimsHint SHOULD contain values from the "JSON Web Token
   Claims" registry created by [RFC7519], in particular claims related
   to remote attestation as registered in [RFC9711] and related
   documents, but MAY contain non-registered values.  The Client SHOULD
   attempt to collect evidence, endorsements, or attestation results
   from its local environment that satisfies these claims, either
   directly if the local environment supports EAT [RFC7519], or mapped
   to the closest equivalent claims in the supported format.  The Client
   MAY ignore any claims that it does not recognize or that it is unable
   to collect remote attestation for.  In other words, the Client SHOULD
   return what it has rather than failing, and allow the Server to
   decide if it is acceptable for the requested certificate profile.

   The verifierEncryptionCredential is for cases where the evidence
   contains sensitive data, such as identifiers that could be linkable
   to a person and therefore qualify as Personally Identifiable
   Information and the Client wishes to protect it against accidental
   logging, for example by HTTP proxies, as it passes through the
   Server's application stack.  The design of passing a URL to the
   encryption public key as part of the remote-attest-01 challenge
   object allows the Server to manage multiple
   verifierEncryptionCredentials, and choose the one appropriate to this
   certificate request flow.  The verifierEncryptionCredential URL
   SHOULD be a semi-static UUID-style URL so that the Client can create
   a cache of previously-fetched encryption credentials, indexed by the
   path component of the verifierEncryptionCredential URL.  The Server
   MAY, for example, use the public key fingerprint as the path
   component in the verifierEncryptionCredential URL.  The referenced
   credential SHOULD be in the JSON Web Key (JWK) [RFC7517] format, but
   MAY be in other reasonable formats such as a DER or PEM encoded X.509
   certificate.

   EDNOTE: in the name of simplicity, make this "MUST JWK"?

2.2.2.  remote-attest-01 Response

   The HTTP POST body to the challenge URL MUST be a raw JSON or CBOR
   CMW [I-D.ietf-rats-msg-wrap], Section 5.2, base64 encoded as
   necessary.

   If the Server provided a verifierEncryptionCredential and the Client
   wishes to make use of it, then the entire CWM payload MUST be placed
   inside a JSON Web Encryption (JWE) envelope [RFC7516].

3.  Example Protocol Flow

3.1.  Step 1: newOrder Request Object

   During the certificate order creation step, the Client sends a
   /newOrder JWS request (Section 7.4 of [RFC8555]) whose payload
   contains an array of identifiers.  To indicate support for remote
   attestation, the client adds one or more rats identifiers to the
   array of identifiers.  This is entirely optional and the server MAY
   choose to challenge for attestation or not according to its
   configuration for the requested certificate profile irrespective of
   whether the client indicated that it is attestation-capable.

   The "rats" identifier MAY appear as the only identifier type in the
   array, but only if the supported remote attestation type is capable
   of proving control of the identifier(s) that will go into the
   certificate's CN or SANs.  For example, a secure-boot style remote
   attestation MAY be capable of proving ownership of a hardware serial
   number, or a WebAuthn / FIDO / Passkey style remote attestation MAY
   be capable of proving control of a FIDO token belonging to a given
   username or email address.  However, more typically the "rats"
   identifier serves to provide supplemental trustworthiness next to a
   direct proof-of-control identity challenge such as DNS-01 or HTTP-01.

   In this example, a client is requesting a certificate for a dns
   identity client01.finance.example and offers that it can provide
   remote attestation of the secure-boot stack of the application server
   via the RATS identifier "secure-boot", as well as provide remote
   attestation from the underlying cryptographic hardware holding the
   private key via the RATS identifier "hsm".  These values refer to the
   ACME Attest Properties Hint Registry defined in Section 4.

   An example extended newOrder JWS request:

     POST /acme/new-order HTTP/1.1
     Content-Type: application/json
     {
       "protected": base64url({
         "alg": "ES256",
       }),
       "payload": base64url({
         "identifiers": [
           { "type": "dns", "value": "client01.finance.example" },
           { "type": "rats", "value": "secure-boot" },
           { "type": "rats", "value": "hsm" },
         ],
       }),
       "signature": "H6ZXtGjTZyUnPeKn...wEA4TklBdh3e454g"
     }

3.2.  Step 2: Order Object

   As explained in [RFC8555], Section 7.1.3, the server returns an Order
   Object.

   An example extended Order Object that includes RATS challenges is:

     POST /acme/new-order HTTP/1.1
     ...

     HTTP/1.1 200 OK
     Content-Type: application/json
     {
       "status": "pending",

       "identifiers": [
           { "type": "dns", "value": "client01.finance.example" },
           { "type": "rats", "value": "secure-boot" },
           { "type": "rats", "value": "hsm" },
       ],

       "authorizations": [
         "https://example.com/acme/authz/PAniVnsZcis",
         "https://example.com/acme/authz/C1uq5Dr+x8GSEJTSKW5B",
         "https://example.com/acme/authz/01jcCDfT0iJBmUlaueum",
       ],

       "finalize": "https://example.com/acme/order/T..fgo/finalize",
     }

   Note that the URLs listed in the authorizations array are arbitrary
   URLs created by the ACME server.  The last component is a randomly
   created string created by the server.  For simplicity, the first URL
   is identical to the example given in [RFC8555].

   The server is not required to match the list of RATS identifiers
   provided by the client.  The server MAY challenge for a subset of the
   RATS identifiers offered by the client, or it MAY challenge for RATS
   identifiers that were not offered by the client.  The server has full
   discretion for deciding what properties are required to be attested
   for the requested certificate profile.

3.3.  Step 3: Authorization Object

   The Client MUST complete the authorizations provided by the server,
   but it MAY do so in any order [RFC8555].

   In this example, the Server has created an Authorization Object for
   the "rats" and "dns" identifiers.  The client accesses each
   authorization object from the URLs given in the Order Object.  In
   this example, the PAniVnsZcis authorization relates to the dns
   identifier, and it is not changed from [RFC8555], Section 8.  The
   C1uq5Dr+x8GSEJTSKW5B authorization corresponds to the RATS "secure-
   boot" identifier.

   Here is an example remote-attest-01 challenge:

   GET https://example.com/acme/authz/C1uq5Dr+x8GSEJTSKW5B HTTP/1.1
   ..

   HTTP/1.1 200 OK
   Content-Type: application/json
   {
     "status": "pending",
     "expires": "2025-09-30T14:09:07.99Z",

     "identifier": {
       "type": "rats",
       "value": "secure-boot"
     },

     "challenges": [
       {
         "type": "remote-attest-01",
         "url": "https://example.com/acme/chall/prV_8235AD9d",
         "status": "pending",
         "freshness_nonce": "yoW1RL2zPBzYEHBQ06Jy",
         "attestClaimsHint": ["hwmodel", "swversion", "submods", "manifests",],
         "verifierEncryptionCredential": "https://example.com/acme/rats-encr-keys/_fyg_W85yTul8zDPygcIgKmj-xA",
       }
     ],
   }

   In this example, the Server is indicating that it wants secure-boot
   type remote attestation including the following claims:

  "attestClaimsHint": ["hwmodel", "swversion", "submods", "manifests",],

   meaning that it is interesting in the type of device and what
   software is running on it.  This field is called a "hint" because the
   ACME Client might not be capable of obtaining remote attestation
   evidence, endorsements, or attestation results that directly map to
   these claims.  Servers SHOULD NOT we written to expect exactly these
   claims back.  This mechanism does not remove the need for vendors to
   perform interop testing against CAs.

   EDNOTE: is the attestClaimsHint actually adding anything useful on
   top of the identifier values of "secure-boot", "hsm", "passkey", etc?

3.4.  Step 4: Respond to RATS Challenge

   The client now queries its local environment to obtain evidence,
   endorsements and/or attestation results to satisfy the RATS
   challenge.

   If the underlying remote attestation technology supports a freshness
   nonce, then the Client passes the (example) token
   yoW1RL2zPBzYEHBQ06Jy into the underlying attestation service as the
   nonce.

   The payload of the RATS Challenge response MUST be a CMW
   [I-D.ietf-rats-msg-wrap], but the underlying payload type within the
   CMW is left unconstrained and therefore the details of collecting the
   remote attestation data for this this step are not in scope for this
   document.  As an example, it might use EAT [RFC9711], TPM-CHARRA
   [RFC9684], or X, or Y (XXX: insert more options)

   Assume the following binary blob is RATS evidence collected by the
   Client:

yePAuQj5xXAnz87/7ItOkDTk5Y4syoW1RL2zPBzYEHBQ06JyUvZDYPYjeTqwlPszb9Grbxw0UAEFx5DxObV1

   This result is sent as a POST to https://example.com/acme/chall/
   prV_8235AD9d

   POST https://example.com/acme/chall/prV_8235AD9d HTTP/1.1
   ..
   Content-Type: application/cmw+cbor

   yePAuQj5xXAnz87/7ItOkDTk5Y4syoW1RL2zPBzYEHBQ06JyUvZDYPYjeTqwlPszb9Grbxw0UAEFx5DxObV1

   (EDIT: change to cwm+jws example that wraps the example binary blob)

   Alternatively, the Client MAY use the JWE format [RFC7516] to encrypt
   the remote attestation data for the Server's
   verifierEncryptionCredential and instead send a POST like this:

   POST https://example.com/acme/chall/prV_8235AD9d HTTP/1.1
   ..
   Content-Type: application/jwt

   eyJhbGciOiJSU0EtT0FFUCIsImVuYyI6IkEyNTZHQ00ifQ.RYSEVOaD[snip]wwEbtY96_8P3a_A.5QLBf5hAXCkP7CdS.XBiai[snip]RWz1D3f.kCIIMWMoObyekuQ33u0oYQ

   ('[snip]' indicates that the JWE has been truncated for publication.)

   The Server decodes the provided CMW [I-D.ietf-rats-msg-wrap].

   The Server MUST perform a full verification of the remote attestation
   data, including verification of the signature against a pre-
   configured trust anchor, and appraisal according to a suitable
   appraisal policy.  The CA's certificate policy is the final authority
   for what trust anchors and appraisal policies will apply and the
   details are not in scope for this document.

   At this point, if the client were to re-retrieve the authorization
   object from step 3, it would observe (if everything was accepted and
   successfully verified) that the status for this challenge would now
   be marked as valid.

3.5.  Step 5: Perform other challenges

   The client SHOULD now perform any other RATS or non-RATS challenges
   that were listed in the Order Object from step 2.  ACME provides no
   ordering constraint on the challenges, so the Client MAY process them
   in any order, including concurrently.

3.6.  Step 6: Finalize Order, retrieve certificate

   At this point, the process continues as described in Section 7.4 of
   [RFC8555].  This means that the finalize action is used, which
   includes a CSR.  If all is well, it will result in a certificate
   being issued.

4.  ACME Attest Properties Hint Registry

   In order for the client to communicate in the newOrder request what
   types of attestation it is capable of producing, and for the server
   to indicate in the newOrder response what properties it requires
   attestation of, this specification creates a new IANA registry called
   "ACME Attest Properties Hint Registry.  The hint is used as the value
   of the "rats" identifier type, as described in {#new-order-req} and
   {#new-order-resp}. In order to preserve vendor flexibility, the
   initial values in the ACME Attest Properties Hint Registry are
   intended to be generic in nature, and decoupled from the RATS
   conceptual message type (evidence, endorsement, or attestation
   result) or attestation data format (EAT (cite), WebAuthn (cite), TPM
   attest_certify (cite), PKIXKeyAttestation (cite), or device-
   proprietary).  This model expects CAs to publish documentation about
   what specific data formats they support, and for vendors to perform
   interoperability testing with CAs to ensure compatibility.
   Ultimately, the CA's certificate policies will be the authority on
   what evidence or attestation results it will accept.

   The ACME Attest Claims Hint Registry is intended to help clients to
   collect evidence or attestation results that are most likely to be
   acceptable to the server, but are not a guaranteed replacement for
   performing interoperability testing between a given attesting device
   and a given CA.  Similarly, an ACME attestation hint may not map one-
   to-one with attestation functionality exposed by the underlying
   attesting device, so ACME clients might need to act as intermediaries
   mapping ACME hints to vendor-specific functionality on a per-
   hardware-vendor basis.

   See Section 7.1 for the initial contents of this new registry.

5.  Example use cases

5.1.  Conflicting duties

   (EDIT: This text might be stale)

   1.  Integration/compatibility difficulty: Integrating SOC and NOC
       requires plenty of customized, case-by-case developing work.
       Especially considering different system vendors, system versions,
       different data models and formats due to different client
       needs... Let alone possible updates.

   2.  Conflict of duties: NOC people do not want SOC people to
       interfere with their daily work, and so do SOC people.  Also, NOC
       people may have limited security knowledge, and SOC people vice
       versa.  Where to draw the line and what is the best tool to help
       them collaborate is a question.

5.2.  Enterprise WiFi Access

   In enterprise access cases, security administrators wish to check the
   security status of an accessing end device before it connects to the
   internal network.  Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) softwares
   can check the security/trustworthiness statuses of the device and
   produce an Attestation Result (AR) if the check passes.  ACME-RATS
   procedures can then be used to redeem a certificate using the AR.

   With that being said, a more specific use case is as follows: an
   enterprise employee visits multiple campuses, and connects to each
   one's WiFi.  For example, an inspector visits many (tens of) power
   substations a day, connects to the local WiFi, download log data,
   proceed to the next and repeat the process.

   Current access solution include: 1.  The inspector remembers the
   password for each WiFi, and conduct the 802.1X EAP password-based
   (PAP/CHAP/MS-CHAPv2) authentication. or 2. an enterprise MDM receives
   the passwords and usernames over application layer connection from
   the MDM server, and enter them on user's behalf.  While Solution 1
   obviously suffer from management burdens induced by massive number of
   password pairs, and password rotation requirements, the drawback of
   Solution 2 is more obsecure, which include:

   a.  Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) situation and MDM is not available.
   b.  Password could risk leakage due to APP compromise, or during
   Internet transmission.  Anyone with leaked password can access,
   without binding of trusted/usual devices. c.  The RADIUS Client/
   Access Point/Switch is not aware of the identity of the accessing
   device, therefore cannot enforce more fine-grained access policies.

   An ideal user story is: 1.  When the inspector is at base (or
   whenever the Remote Attestation-based check is available), he get his
   device inspected and redeem a certificate using ACME-RATS. 2.  When
   at substation, the inspector authenticate to the WiFi using EAP-TLS,
   where all the substations have the company root CA installed. 2*.
   Alternatively, the Step 2 can use EAP-repeater mode, where the RADIUS
   Client redirects the request back to the RADIUS Server for more
   advanced checks.

5.3.  BYOD devices

   Another example is issuing S/MIME certificates to BYOD devices only
   if they can prove via attestation that they are registered to a
   corporate MDM and the user they are registered to matches the user
   for which a certificate has been requested.

   In this case, the Server might challenge the client to prove that it
   is properly-registered to the enterprise to the same user as the
   subject of the requested S/MIME certificate, and that the device is
   running the corporate-approved security agents.

5.4.  Private key in hardware

   In some scenarios the CA might require that the private key
   corresponding to the certificate request is stored in cryptographic
   hardware and non-extractable.  For example, the certificate profile
   for some types of administrative credentials may be required to be
   stored in a token or smartcard.  Or the CA might be required to
   enforce that the private key is stored in a FIPS-certified HSM
   running in a configuration compliant with its FIPS certificate --
   this is the case, for example, with CA/Browser Forum Code Signing
   certificates [CABF-CSBRs] which can be attested for example via
   [RATSKA].

   It could also be possible that the requested certificate profile does
   not require the requested key to be hardware-backed, but that the CA
   will issue the certificate with extra assurance, for example an extra
   policy OID or a longer expiry period, if attestation of hardware can
   be provided.

6.  Security Considerations

   The attestation-result-01 challenge (the Passport Model) is the
   mandatory to implement.  The encrypted-evidence-01 challenge (the
   background-check model) is optional.

   In all cases the Server has to be able to verify Attestation Results
   from the Verifier.  To do that it requires appropriate trust anchors.

   In the Passport model, Evidence -- which may contain personally
   identifiable information (PII)) -- is never seen by the ACME Server.
   Additionally, there is no need for the Verifier to accept connections
   from ACME Server(s).  The Attester/Verifier relationship used in the
   Passport Model leverages a pre-existing relationship.  For instance
   if the Verifier is operated by the manufacturer of the Attester (or
   their designate), then this is the same relationship that would be
   used to obtain updated software/firmware.  In this case, the trust
   anchors may also be publically available, but the Server does not
   need any further relationship with the Verifier.

   In the background-check model, Evidence is sent from the Attester to
   the ACME Server.  The ACME Server then relays this Evidence to a
   Verifier.  The Evidence is encrypted so that the Server it never able
   to see any PII which might be included.  The choice of Verifier is
   more complex in the background-check model.  Not only does ACME
   Server have to have the correct trust anchors to verify the resulting
   Attestation Results, but the ACME Server will need some kind of
   business relationship with the Verifier in order for the Verifier to
   be willing to appraise Evidence.

   The trustworthy identifier is not an actual identifier.  It does not
   result in any specific contents to the certificate Subject or
   SubjectAltName.

7.  IANA Considerations

7.1.  ACME Attest Properties Hint Registry

   IANA is requested to open a new registry, XXXXXXXX

   Type: designated expert

   The registry has the following columns:

   *  Property Hint: the string value to be placed within an ACME
      identifier of type "rats".

   *  Description: a description of the general property which the
      client is expected to attest.

   The initial registry contents is shown in the table below.

   +==================+================================================+
   | Property Hint    | Description                                    |

   |                  | what type.  Typically this means the           |
   |                  | client will produce whatever remote            |

   |                  | associated with this certificate request       |
   |                  | is stored in cryptographic hardware such       |
   |                  | as a TPM or PKCS#11 HSM.  In the case of       |
   |                  | PKCS#11 HSMs, the attestation SHOULD           |
   |                  | contain the PKCs#11 properties of the          |
   |                  | private key storage, as well as an             |
   |                  | indication of whether the cryptographic        |
   |                  | module is operating in FIPS mode.              |
   +------------------+------------------------------------------------+
   | "secure_boot"    | Attestation from the device's onboard          |
   |                  | secure-boot stack of the device running        |
   |                  | the application.                               |
   +------------------+------------------------------------------------+
   | "os_patch_level" | Attestation to the version or patch            |
   |                  | level of the device's operating system.        |
   +------------------+------------------------------------------------+
   | "sw_manifest"    | A manifest list of all software                |
   |                  | currently running on the device.               |
   +------------------+------------------------------------------------+
   | "fido2"          | A request for FIDO2-based user                 |
   |                  | authentication; maybe this is to               |
   |                  | validate a user identifier directly            |
   |                  | against the FIDO2 data, or maybe this          |
   |                  | serves as a second-factor to the CA's          |
   |                  | certificate pickup flow.                       |
   +------------------+------------------------------------------------+

                                  Table 1

   In general, the target environment that the Server wants to be
   remotely attested is the environment where the application is
   running.  The "hsm" property is an exception to this because this
   wants attestation from the cryptographic module instead.

   In cases where the ACME client is running on a different host from
   the application, remote attestation always refers to the application
   host.  In other words, a centralized ACME client MUST fulfill the
   ACME rats challenge by getting the application server that will
   ultimately use the certificate to query its local environment for
   remote attestation, and the ACME client MUST NOT present remote
   attestation from the host where it is running.

   TODO: this is normative text that should move up to the body.

   EDNOTE: I am somewhat surprised that a registry like this does not
   already exist associated with CMW.
